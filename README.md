2. Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) (kg/m^3): The quantity of blast furnace slag, measured in kilograms per cubic meter, incorporated into the concrete mix.
3. Fly Ash (component 3) (kg/m^3): The volume of fly ash, measured in kilograms per cubic meter, included in the concrete mixture.
4. Water (component 4) (kg/m^3): The amount of water, measured in kilograms per cubic meter, used in the concrete mix.
5. Superplasticizer (component 5) (kg/m^3): The quantity of superplasticizer, measured in kilograms per cubic meter, added to improve the workability of the concrete.
6. Coarse Aggregate (component 6) (kg/m^3): The mass of coarse aggregate, measured in kilograms per cubic meter, utilized in the concrete mix.
7. Fine Aggregate (component 7) (kg/m^3): The amount of fine aggregate, measured in kilograms per cubic meter, incorporated into the concrete mixture.
8. Age (day): The age of the concrete samples, measured in days, at the time of testing for compressive strength.
9. Concrete Compressive Strength (MPa): The compressive strength of the concrete samples, measured in megapascals (MPa), indicating the ability of the concrete to withstand axial loads.
